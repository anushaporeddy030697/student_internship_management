## Student Internship Managememt System

### Introduction

We are a group of 5 people working on a project to create a student internship management system. Here students can apply for jobs which are posted by different companies and admin is an intermediate panel between students and companies. By designing login sites where users may register for an account and use it, we establish an interface for students, administrators, and businesses. By logging onto their accounts, Students can apply for jobs, Companies can post jobs and a brief description of the position in their accounts, and Administrators can accept or reject both the Student and Company posts.
