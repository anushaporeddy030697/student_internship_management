Iam chennu venkata shashankar who is one of the team member in the project "Student Internship Management". I work for web design using XMl.

I am the one who proposed the Student Internship Management System, and because I enjoy web design and have made several web sites, my expertise will be helpful to the project's success. we collaborate to complete this project successfully, and I'll do my part by taking the initiative as teamwork is more about us than it is about me.
